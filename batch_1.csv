 Anand Hembrom,NA,"""The land is like our mother. We cannot sell it, and we cannot live without it."" The demands of the residents of Nagri, a small, primarily tribal village 10 km to the north of Ranchi, seem straightforward enough: to be allowed to continue cultivating the land that has always sustained them. This aspiration is unfortunately under threat. For over a year now, the government of Jharkhand has been involved in a campaign to take away 227 acres of agricultural land from its adivasi owners in order to set up the Ranchi campuses of IIM, IIT and the National University of Study and Research in Law (NURSL). In today's video, IndiaUnheard Jharkhand State Co-ordinator Anand Hembrom documents the people's movement against this ruinous operation. The government claims to have acquired the 227 acres in 1957--58 for an expansion of the Bisra Agricultural University under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894. Out of 153 raiyats (tenants), however, only 25 had accepted payment at the time, with a large majority of 128 refusing to sell. In his article in the Jharkhand Mirror (http://jharkhandmirror.org/tag/nagri-peoples-movement/), human rights activist Gladson Dungdung also discusses how the Land Acquisition Act should not technically apply to Nagri which is located in a 5th schedule area where the Chhota Nagpur Tenancy Act is in force. At any rate, the university was never expanded and the issue lay buried for the next 55 years. The villagers continued to farm their land and even pay revenue on it. It was only in 2008 that they discovered they no longer had a legal claim to it when 13 acres were casually allotted to the construction of a ring road. Then in 2011, the disputed ground was distributed among IIM, IIT and NURSL. Peaceful at first, the raiyats sought redress at the Jharkhand High Court and the Supreme Court, and even addressed an appeal to the Governor. Meeting with rejection everywhere, they grew desperate and took to the streets. On the 4th of July 2012, angry protestors broke down the boundary wall at the IIM construction site and were lathi charged by the police for their act of rebellion. They responded by going on strike and putting up road blocks. The movement then gained momentum, with support gradually coming in from different political parties and organizations. Anand Hembrom, who was present on the scene, discussed the ground situation with us: ""The movement started out as a peaceful protest. The villagers sat at the construction site for at least two months. They practically lived there. Someone would cook food, and everyone would eat and sleep in the fields. FIRs were lodged against protestors and the people started to grow agitated. After the breaking of the IIM boundary wall, the state grew violent. The police conducted a lathi charge and many persons were seriously injured. "" What did the High Court say when the people pleaded their case? ""It dismissed the plea and ordered construction work to be started at the site. The Chief Justice of the Jharkhand High Court is actually also the Chancellor of the Law University. This is a conflict of interest. Later, when the people continued to resist, A High Power Committee was formed to investigate the issue, but nothing concrete has come of it."" And the Supreme Court..? ""The Supreme Court threw away the case file without even looking at it. The judges said that the land had been acquired in 1958 and that they saw no reason to interfere in the matter now. But that's not true. The land was never properly purchased ."" What exactly do the people want? ""They want their land back. Their livelihood depends on it and their identity is defined by it. They would not sell it at any price, even if the purchase proposed were a legal one. At the moment, they are being cheated and exploited by the State. It is not that they are against development, but they need their agricultural land. They even offered the government some land 5 km away in exchange. The terrain there is infertile and cannot be put to use by farmers, but that should not affect a university campus. It is also closer to Ranchi. But the government insists on taking away the cultivable fields around Nagri, without even giving a proper reason why."" So what is the situation like at present? ""The movement has grown quieter. Paramilitary forces which were deployed after the protests of last year are still stationed at the construction site. The broken boundary wall has not been rebuilt yet and all work is at a standstill. The people have recently submitted another petition to the Supreme Court, and we hope very much that this time the verdict will be different.""

 Bharti Kumari,SHIKHA PAHARIN," regular class in Kujuma Government School is interrupted with a deafening blast. The walls shook and the ceiling threatened to fall down. But in five minutes later, it was a usual business for the 40-50 children studying in the government primary school. This is not a warzone, this is an everyday reality the 5000 residents, including children of Kujuma, Dhanbad face since the past 20 years due to the open-cast mines in the area. The Kujama coal mines are in close proximity to the Jharia coal mines, which have been on fire for 100 years. The residents accuse the Bharat Coking Coal Limited, Dhanbad (BCCL), a subsidiary of Coal India Limited has been complacent about their plight since the past few years. The mine is just 250 meters away from the school, creating a dangerous situation for the children and teachers. “One boy was sitting with water in his hand. In a while, it started steaming,"" says Sonali, a student. Imagine the high temperatures and noxious fumes the children are exposed to. Another danger these kids face is the fear of a collapsing school. The constant dynamite explosions have weakened our buildings. Cracks have appeared on our walls and floors. It can all crumble at any time,” says Ramesh Chandra Pal, a teacher at the government school. The Indian government plans to nearly double coal production by 2020 and the Indian state-controlled coal mining company Coal India wants to produce a billion tonnes of coal every year. But this plan of expansion and growth is shutting out indigenous Adivasi communities for access to agriculture, education, health and importantly laws such as Forest Rights Acts, PESA ACT in states such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha that protect their rights over their lands. The denial of access to tribal affects at least eight percent of the country's population of 1.2 billion people. Bharati Kumari belongs to one such indigenous tribe in Dhanbad district. Along with Video Volunteers, she has made several videos to document and expose the denial to basic government facilities and apathy by Coal India subsidiaries, central government ministries and state government authorities in Jharkhand. The principal of the school, Premprakash Dev has made formal complaints several times but has had neglected as a reply. “We have informed the educational authorities with letters regarding the disaster. There was also an order from the DC that it be shut down and some arrangement is made. But I am unsure why this wasn't done,"" says Premprakash. The village residents are coal-mine workers or farm labourers, earning a monthly income of hardly Rs 200- 500. They can't afford to send their children to private school, neither can they afford to travel for school.The Kujuma Government School is their only hope is to achieve a good education and break the cycle of oppression they were born into.

 Mukesh Rajak,NA,"Street vendors struggle for their livelihood in Jharkhand. About the video: Street vendors of Madhapur city in Jharkhand have lost their shops and only source of income because of the 'Atikraman Hatao Abhiyan' (encroachment removal drive) ruling to clear illegal encroachments on public roads and government land. With only a short notice from the municipal official, the hawkers had to leave with no place to relocate their stalls. Now they struggle to provide for themselves and their families. The Community Correspondent says: Mukesh Rajak, India Unheard Community Correspondent from Madhupur, Jharkhand says: ""The government is constructing shops in other areas but these can only be rented by the wealthier shopkeepers. The local street vendors however do not have the money to pay for these stores. They need a market where they can sell their goods on the basis of an affordable rent."" The Rights of the People: With approximately 1 crore street vendors across India, the Supreme Court has decided that the hawker needs to be recognized as an integral part of urban society and economics. National Policy for Urban Street Vendors promises that the vendors will be involved in development projects concerning their livelihood. The main objectives of the policy are to give the street vendors a legal status and make infrastructure and facilities available to them so they can sell their goods. Call to Action: The vendors hit by the encroachment removal rule have neither been involved nor integrated in the process of the development project. The 'Atikraman Hatao Abhiyan' has no appropriate provisions for the rehabilitation and the relocation of the lakhs of vendors and their families who have lost their livelihoods to the drive. The street vendors demand their basic right to livelihood. They request an appointed, affordable space where they can continue to sell their wares and earn their daily bread.

 Xavier Hamsay,NA,"The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) intends to help farmers who are economically weak to take credit at lesser rates to buy seeds, fertilizers and other important things needed for irrigation and farming. But what happens when a hopeful farmer is scammed by the very bank official who appeared as a friend, scams and takes the credit? In West Singhbhum district of Budgaon block, in the name of KCC loan, 19 villagers have been scammed of Rs.15,44,260. Budhni Bodra is one of these people in Kilung village, who spends her life in poverty along with her old mother. She had applied for the loan 3-4 years back. “We wanted it for work, not for poverty, we wanted to improve the farming fields,” Budhni recalls. But a bank employee, Sanjay Nag took her form and passbook and forged loan worth Rs.50,000 in Budhri's name from Bank of India, Bangaon. With the help of Xavier Hamsay, a social activist and a community correspondent Budhni is standing up against corruption and has taken a stand. “If I had taken the loan, had the money in my hand, spent it, then I would have repaid the load. I can't repay it, whoever has used the loan, let him repay it,"" she says. Xavier and Video Volunteers' Jharkhand team has taken up the issue.

 Basanti Soren,NA,"One of the most appreciated, publicized and actually needed social welfare programs is the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Gramin). This program is targeted towards the villages of our country that house around three-fourth of India's population. It aims to provide comprehensive sanitation coverage such as toilets and rid our villages from the menace of open defecation. One of the major initiatives under this program is to build community and household toilets. The Swachh Bharat Gramin website reports that over 1.4 lakh villages have self-declared themselves to be open defecation free – which is a very impressive and commendable achievement in one year. But having a motorized vehicle that allows you to travel from point to point will only be useful if A) proper fuel is available and B) procurement of that fuel is within the grasp of the vehicle owner. Without these two, your vehicle is of no value per se. The above example is the metaphor for the SBA initiative. Even though we are building toilets willy-nilly all around the country we need to look at certain infrastructural requirements that are vital to ensure that these toilets can be utilized effectively. Stakeholders have to pay close attention to water supply, drainage, cleanliness and material quality in order to ensure that this initiative actually creates value for the underprivileged brothers and sisters that reside in our villages. As seen in this video – even though the toilets have been built – there is no water supply. Nearest water source is the local river and fetching water from the river is a formidable task. Without water, these toilets cannot be utilized for their intended purpose and will be merely reduced to just a number that looks very good in a formal report. Our network has reported similar cases across India. See the videos here, here and here. While the residents have accepted these welfare programs with open-arms, the administration is falling short of providing them the quality services which they were promised. It is the responsibility of all stakeholders to ensure that these programs are well thought out and all contingencies are taken care off. Call the PWD Executive Engineer of Ramgarh, Jharkhand on +91-9631180046 about this problem and help the residents of Ramgarh get toilets.",sanitation,2017-01-09 00:00:00.000,2022-11-18 10:53:26.859,RAMGARH,True,False,False,PHD, NA,2017,1,9,2022,11,18,True,water ki suvidha mile.
 Basanti Soren,NA,"For the women of a remote village in Jharkhand, a walk into the nearby forests is still the only way they can answer nature's call. Because the much-promised bathrooms to be constructed for every village in India have still eluded them. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was launched in 2014 with much fanfare. For a cleaner India, an India where toilets would be available, if not in every home but many for each community, each village. The hope is that every state government will be able to fulfill their commitments by the year 2019. The women of Lopongtandi village in Jharkhand, consisting of about 45 families, keep hoping a few bathrooms will be constructed in the near future so that they don' t have to keep trekking to the jungle for their basic bodily needs. As Meena Kumari says, it is embarrassing to walk into the forest every time. There are always some naughty boys or young men lurking behind the trees to catch a glimpse of a woman in action, no matter how hard they hide in their saris. Geeta Handsa waits in frustration for at least a few toilets to be built so that they finally have their privacy.

 Mary Nisha Hansda,HARIHAR NAGBANSI,"In the hills of Jharkhand reside the ancient tribe called the Sauria Paharias (hill dwellers). This Scheduled Tribe, considered as one of the oldest dwellers of the Santhal Pragana division – a largely tribal-dominated area of the state. They largely keep away from mainstream population and depend on agriculture, which they produce by clearing small patches of forest during the monsoons. For the rest of the months, they sustain themselves by sourcing and selling forest produce like sal leaves, mahua flowers, kokum, honey etc in the local markets. But the loss of habitat due to shrinking forest cover due to external intervention and so-called 'development', the Sauria Paharia tribe's population is on a steady, unfortunate decline. According to the 2001 census, the tribe's population was 61,121 but it steadily declined to 46,222 over the next decade. One of the prime reasons for the decline had been the scarcity of water in the region – both for sustained agriculture and for consumption.",labor rights,2017-02-08 00:00:00.000,2022-11-18 10:53:26.859,GONDA,False,False,False,NA, NA,2017,2,8,2022,11,18,True,positive story
