# Philosophy of the work :
1. Keep it simple 
    - Comnmunity is rural - So less words and more pictures
    - Leaders - Less options - More like a journal
    - Local officials - help plan their strategy and resources
    - People - Visible progress in rural areas
    - Future collabs 
        - Numbers and the work done so far
        - Make it easy enough for them to see the areas with potential for "greater impact with lesser resources"
        - What can be done and what exactly would NGO's help with?

2. Emphasize the video in "The Video volunteers" 
    - Goal is to showcase the contributions 
    - "Double the impact rate"

3. Project exactly how well they can do? Simple predictive model.

4. They have not come forward asking for help to bring in more people, this is the hidden and implict motive of the work. So it is now a more clever problem and requires even smarter potrayal of this aspect.

# Requirements :

Better maintainance :
1. Make it easy to search and filter.

Expansion and reaching out : 
2. '... tell a better story and give a better picture of various districts'.
3. Bring in more potential collaborators 
    - Who? determines what kind of data will be imp
4. How can we present this data in a way that makes it stand out and be impactful
    - Keep it simple as the many different communities will be using this dashboard.     


# Why is the current dashboard not enough?
- You must know the names in order to search.


# Elements : 
- Know the leaders tab - For evaluation of each person's work
- Change the language to Hindi
- Drill down in terms of State-> District->Village
- Approved and yet to be approved ones with reasons


- Video tiles showing info like CC

# The NGO model :
1. Comunity leader makes an initial video about an issue
    - What all could be there?

2. They show this to local officials 

3. Solving the issue - the Impact video.
    - How do we know for sure that this issue is resolved? 
    - Can the people who are facing the problems verify this?
    - Can this be verified at an instituional level? Gram-Panchayat. Need more accountability.
